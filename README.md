# The Zombie Gospel: A Deprogramming Narrative

**How Ancient Philosophy Built a Counterfeit Gospel**

by Richard Joseph Larose Jr.

---

## About This Work

*The Zombie Gospel* is a systematic theological analysis examining how Greek philosophical anthropology—particularly the doctrine of the immortal soul—infiltrated Christianity and gave rise to the "Once Saved, Always Saved" (OSAS) doctrine. This work traces the historical development from the Maccabean resistance against Hellenization through modern evangelical theology.

### Purpose

This manuscript is made freely available to:
- Expose the architectural foundations of autonomous salvation theology
- Demonstrate the biblical case for Hebrew holistic anthropology
- Provide recovery resources for those exiting high-control religious groups
- Equip believers to recognize and resist philosophical corruption of biblical faith

## Key Themes

- **Greek vs. Hebrew Anthropology**: The fundamental incompatibility between substance ontology and biblical categories
- **Apostolic Defense**: How Paul, Peter, James, John, and Jude fought coordinated battles against philosophical infiltration
- **Historical Betrayal**: The 16-century trajectory from apostolic resistance to patristic compromise
- **Systematic Demolition**: Complete architectural analysis of OSAS's bedrock, foundation, pillars, and doctrine
- **Recovery**: The path from autonomous certainty to covenant relationship

## Structure

### Part One: The Epistemological Bedrock
Examines solo scriptura and substance ontology as prerequisites for autonomous salvation

### Part Two: The Epistemological Darkness
Analyzes the κατέχω (katechō) suppression mechanism and cognitive imprisonment

### Part Three: The Four Pillars
Demolishes the defensive mechanisms: Pre-Trib Rapture, Dispensationalism, Manifestations, and Additional Arguments

### Part Four: The Doctrine Itself
Direct exegetical confrontation with OSAS through five decisive biblical passages

### Part Five: The Pinnacle
Reveals how OSAS achieves Genesis 3:5's promise: "You shall be as gods"

### Part Six: The Other Path
Demonstrates how Catholic/Orthodox apostolic succession creates the same autonomous structure

### Part Seven: The Apostolic Defense
Documents what the church fathers adopted and the apostles died resisting

## A Word to Critics

If you're reading this to debunk it:

Good. That's exactly what you should do. Test everything against Scripture. This work **invites** critical examination because truth survives scrutiny while error crumbles under it.

The request: engage the **arguments**, not just the conclusions. Demonstrate where the:
- Biblical exegesis fails
- Historical documentation is inaccurate  
- Logical reasoning breaks down
- Greek/Hebrew analysis errs

**If you find genuine errors, document them.** Truth seekers correct mistakes rather than defend them.

## Soli Deo Gloria

*To God Alone Be Glory*

"These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the Word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether those things were so." (Acts 17:11, CWT)
